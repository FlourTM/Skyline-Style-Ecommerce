# Skyline Style

## <br> Introduction
Skyline Style is a mock e-commerce website designed for young adults that offers a wide range of clothing products. It was drafted, designed, and implemented in under three months as a capstone project for CSC 4900 Advanced Software Project class.

The website is accessible on any device that can access an internet browser, providing users with a seamless shopping experience. Users can browse and "purchase" items using both desktop and mobile applications, making it easier for them to shop at their convenience. The website offers a range of capabilities, including the ability to create and manage accounts, browse and filter products, add items to carts or wishlists, and switch between light and dark themes. Although the checkout procedure is available, no products, payment, or shipping services are provided. The products are created and displayed through Hygraph's content management system.
